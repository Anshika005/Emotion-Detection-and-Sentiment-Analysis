# Emotion-Detection-and-Sentiment-Analysis
This repository explores the evolution and techniques of sentiment and emotion analysis, focusing on its historical development and current advancements. Originally starting in the 1950s with basic methods for text analysis, the field has evolved significantly with the introduction of machine learning, which enables more nuanced sentiment detection through contextual and linguistic analysis.

As social media has expanded, the limitations of text-only analysis became evident, leading to the development of multimodal sentiment analysis. This approach integrates text with visual and auditory data, such as images and videos, to provide a deeper understanding of emotional expression. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, including handling sarcasm, negation, and the rapidly changing nature of social media language.

The project reviews sentiment analysis techniques, including lexicon-based and machine learning methods, and examines the emerging field of multimodal analysis. It highlights both the challenges and opportunities within sentiment analysis, offering insights into its applications in business, politics, and social media.
